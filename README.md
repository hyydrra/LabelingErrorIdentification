  <h1>Labeling Error Identification</h1>
  <p>This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the use of a modified Confident Learning algorithm proposed as the course project of ECE720 at the Uinveristy of Alberta for identifying mislabeled data in the AG News and CIFAR10 datasets. The modified algorithm uses artificially generated out-of-scope data to enhance the identification of mislabeled examples, and it outperforms the baseline method for cleaning noisy datasets.</p>
  
  <h2>Files</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><code>Ag_news_labeling_error_identification.ipynb</code>: Jupyter notebook for identifying mislabeled data in the Ag news dataset.</li>
    <li><code>CIFAR10_labeling_error_identification.ipynb</code>: Jupyter notebook for identifying mislabeled data in the CIFAR10 dataset.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <p>The notebooks provided need some cleaning up, and you might have to change some file paths to make them work. I'll update them soon with a cleaner version. (By the way, the CIFAR notebook is already clean.).</p>
  
<!--   <h2>Dependencies</h2>
  <p>The notebooks require the following dependencies:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Python 3.6 or later</li>
    <li>PyTorch</li>
    <li>NumPy</li>
    <li>Matplotlib</li>
    <li>Pandas</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can install these dependencies using pip or conda.</p>
